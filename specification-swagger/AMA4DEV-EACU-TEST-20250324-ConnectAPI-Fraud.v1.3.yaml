  version: 1.4.A20260121
  description: |
    **Preliminary Note:** This document aims at describing how to use the Amadeus JSON API for core Payment *Operation* management, dealing with payment transactions.
    Amadeus APIs comply with Amadeus REST/JSON Rules & Guideline v1.3 and are based on *application/vnd.amadeus+json* [media type](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml). For further details please refer to [developers.amadeus.com](https://developers.amadeus.com).

    ## Resource: *Operations*

    ### Payment Operation ontology

    #### *Fraud screening*
    TBD

    ## Quickstart Guide
    ### 1. Merchant account setup
    Outpayce sends payment operations on behalf of merchants. A merchant is identified in your system by a *MERCHANT_ACCOUNT*. It may even be attributed a MERCHANT_LOGIN with an associated MERCHANT_PASSWORD.

    ### 2. Fraud Screening
    This endpoint allows to perform fraud screening operation. It returns the recommended actions to be performed by the merchant. 

    There are 2  possible actions :
      - ACCEPT
      - REJECT
      
    In case of ACCEPT the merchant should go on with the payment process. 
    In case of REJECT the merchant should not go on with the payment process

    #### Examples

    ##### Fraud screening request
    ```

    ## Limitations
    The current version of this service requires a payment method CARD to be provided in input. 

    ## API considerations

    ### application/vnd.amadeus+json overall structure
    Each request/response body is enclosed in a JSON envelope. The set of root level keys of that envelope is limited and support the API consumer pre-interactions. The main root level key is _data_ in input or in successful responses, and _errors_ for failing responses.

    Here is an example of a successful response body:

        {
            "warnings": [
                ...
            ],
            "data": {
                ...
            },
            "dictionaries": {
                ...
            },
            "included": [
                ...
            ],
            "meta": {
                ...
            }
        }

    And here is an example of a successful collection response body:

        {
            "warnings": [
                ...
            ],
            "data": [
                ...
            ],
            "dictionaries": {
                ...
            },
            "included": [
                ...
            ],
            "meta": {
                ...
            },
        }

    Please note that request bodies are not expected to contain warnings or errors.

    Here would be an example of a error response body:

        {
            "warnings": [
                ...
            ],
            "errors": [
                ...
            ],
            "meta": {
                ...
            }
        }

    Warnings are non-blocking issues encountered during processing. Errors are functionally blocking issues preventing a successful processing.


    ### Semantic HTTP statuses

    In this API, HTTP statuses are semantically applied.

    Here are the main successful ones to consider (non-exhaustive list):
    - **200 OK.** Processing of the operation is successful.
    - **201 Created - FREQUENT business functional success.** Request was processed and resource instance was properly created.
    - **202 Accepted - FREQUENT business functional success.** Request was received but processing of the operation is still ongoing (e.g. asynchronous processing).

    And here are the main error categories returned (non-exhaustive list):
    - **409 Conflict.** Conflicting operation, for instance due to concurrent long action or locked resource.
    - **422 Unprocessable Entity - FREQUENT business functional failure.** Unprocessable request, mostly due to business context. 
    - **424 Failed Dependency - FREQUENT business functional failure.** Business functional rejection from an external party downstream.
    - **502 Bad Gateway.** Communication error in an external party downstream.
    - **504 Gateway Timeout.** External party timeout error.
